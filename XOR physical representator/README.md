# XOR physical representator 
This gives your physical visualization of how XOR operation works. 

## Usage 

It takes parameters 

```
python xor.py 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ... n
```

It asks for the xor base value

```
The value for Base : x
```

Gives a resut
```
bit-wise operation XOR >>> 111000(56) ^ 111(7)
result = 111111(63) = ?
string: ?
```

This code was made for the Hack The Box challenge : impossible password.


To give more clarity to what are the operations doing.
